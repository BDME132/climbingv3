# Emigration Canyon Climbing Guide

Emigration Canyon offers a solid mix of sport and trad climbing on decent sandstone and conglomerate rock, just minutes from Salt Lake City. The area has developed a reputation for both quality routes and some intentionally chossy climbs that have become local favorites. Access is straightforward, but respect private property and park responsibly along the canyon road.
