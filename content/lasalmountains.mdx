# La Sal Mountains Climbing Guide

The La Sals offer some of Utah's most diverse climbing, from solid sport routes on quality sandstone to excellent bouldering and even ice climbing in winter. The area sees fewer crowds than Moab's main crags, making it perfect for climbers looking to escape the circus while still getting on great rock. Access is generally straightforward, though some areas require high-clearance vehicles.
