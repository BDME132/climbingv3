# Indian Creek Climbing Guide

Indian Creek is the world's premier splitter crack destination, where perfect parallel-sided cracks split through Wingate sandstone for hundreds of feet. This is where you come to dial in your crack technique and test your jamming endurance on some of the most classic traditional routes in North America. Access is straightforward via Highway 211, but respect the desert environment and pack out everything you bring in.
