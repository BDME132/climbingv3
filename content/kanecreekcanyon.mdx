# Kane Creek Canyon Climbing Guide

Kane Creek Canyon offers some of Utah's most varied traditional climbing, from mellow multi-pitch adventures to burly single-pitch testpieces. The area draws climbers for its quality Wingate and Navajo sandstone, diverse route selection, and relatively easy access from Moab. Check current access conditions as some areas may have seasonal restrictions.
