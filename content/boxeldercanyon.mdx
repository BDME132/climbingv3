# Box Elder Canyon Climbing Guide

Box Elder Canyon offers solid intermediate climbing with a mix of sport and trad options spread across quality limestone walls. It's a go-to spot when you want something more challenging than the usual beginner crags but aren't ready to throw down on the area's harder test pieces. The canyon stays relatively cool and sees less traffic than some of the more popular destinations.
