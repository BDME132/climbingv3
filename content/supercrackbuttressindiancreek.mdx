# Supercrack Buttress Indian Creek Climbing Guide

Supercrack Buttress is the crown jewel of Indian Creek, serving up some of the world's most perfect splitter cracks in classic Wingate sandstone. This is where you come to dial in your crack technique on everything from mellow hand cracks to desperate thin fingers, with the iconic Supercrack of the Desert anchoring the wall. Park at the Supercrack lot and approach via the standard trail—respect closures during raptor nesting season (March-July).
