# Kanab Area Climbing Climbing Guide

The Kanab area offers solid sandstone climbing with a mix of traditional cracks, sport routes, and quality bouldering scattered across several crags. It's a great spot for climbers looking to escape the crowds while still finding varied terrain, though note that Port of Entry Crag is currently closed to climbing. The area sees less traffic than nearby Zion, making it perfect for a quieter climbing experience.
