# The Schoolroom Ogden Climbing Guide

The Schoolroom offers some of Ogden's most accessible sport climbing, with everything from mellow warm-ups to serious test pieces on quality limestone. It's a solid choice when you want variety without the approach, though respect private property and park appropriately. The routes here tend to be well-bolted and see regular traffic from the local scene.
