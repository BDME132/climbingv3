# Clear Creek Canyon Utah Climbing Guide

Clear Creek Canyon delivers quality limestone sport climbing and solid trad options just outside Salt Lake City. The canyon offers everything from mellow single-pitch routes to technical face climbs, with several distinct crags that each have their own character. Access is straightforward, but respect private property and park only in designated areas.
