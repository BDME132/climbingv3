# Split Mountain Climbing Guide

Split Mountain offers traditional climbing in a scenic desert setting near Dinosaur National Monument. The area sees fewer crowds than other Utah destinations, making it a solid choice for climbers looking to get on some rock without the circus. Access is straightforward through the Split Mountain Campground area.

**Note: This area has very limited route data available. Only one route is currently documented in our database. Climbers should consult additional resources and local knowledge for a complete picture of climbing opportunities at Split Mountain.**
