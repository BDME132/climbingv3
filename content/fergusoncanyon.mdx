# Ferguson Canyon Climbing Guide

Ferguson Canyon delivers some of Utah's most accessible traditional climbing, with solid quartzite walls that offer everything from mellow multi-pitch adventures to technical single-pitch challenges. The canyon's religious-themed route names reflect the area's spiritual vibe, and the short approach makes it perfect for after-work sessions or full-day cragging. Respect private property on the approach and stick to established trails.
