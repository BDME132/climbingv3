# Big Bend Moab Climbing Guide

Big Bend offers some of Moab's most concentrated bouldering alongside classic desert tower climbing. The area is famous for its high-quality sandstone problems ranging from mellow warm-ups to world-class testpieces, plus a handful of stellar trad routes on Big Bend Butte. It's a solid choice when you want variety without driving all over the desert.
