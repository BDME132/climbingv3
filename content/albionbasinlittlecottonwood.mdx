# Albion Basin Little Cottonwood Climbing Guide

Albion Basin offers some of the most accessible alpine sport and trad climbing in Little Cottonwood Canyon, with everything from mellow multi-pitch trad on Devil's Castle to dialed sport routes on the various "Stash" walls. The area sees heavy traffic during summer months, so get there early for the classics. Note that this is within the Wasatch National Forest and standard LNT principles apply.
