# Snow Canyon State Park Climbing Guide

Snow Canyon delivers classic Navajo sandstone climbing just outside St. George, with everything from mellow trad lines to steep sport routes. The red rock here is generally solid, and the winter climbing season makes it a perfect escape when other areas are snowed in. Most areas require a short approach through the state park, so grab a day pass at the entrance.
