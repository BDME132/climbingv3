# Woodbury Desert Climbing Guide

Woodbury Desert serves up quality sport climbing on solid sandstone with routes spanning from mellow 5.6s to world-class 5.14s. The area's main draws are Black and Tan Crag and Kelly's Rock Crag, both offering excellent stone and well-bolted lines that make for productive sessions year-round. Access is straightforward, but respect private property boundaries and pack out your trash.
