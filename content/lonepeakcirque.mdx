# Lone Peak Cirque Climbing Guide

Lone Peak Cirque is Utah's premier alpine trad climbing destination, offering everything from mellow multi-pitch adventures to world-class hard routes on bulletproof quartzite. The cirque sits high in the Wasatch at over 10,000 feet, so expect a solid approach hike and afternoon thunderstorms in summer. Access requires navigating private property—respect all posted signs and stick to established trails.
