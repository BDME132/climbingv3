# Fishlake National Forest Climbing

Fishlake National Forest offers solid sport climbing on volcanic rock, with most routes concentrated around Meadow Rappel Rock. The area delivers quality single-pitch routes in a beautiful forest setting, though it's still developing compared to Utah's more established crags. Access is generally straightforward, but check current forest service regulations before heading out.
