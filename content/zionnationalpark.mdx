# Zion National Park Climbing Guide

Zion delivers world-class sandstone climbing on towering walls that'll make your neck hurt just looking up. The park is famous for its big wall adventures and classic multi-pitch routes, but there's solid single-pitch climbing too if you're not ready for the full commitment. Just remember you'll need permits for overnight bivouacs on the big walls.

## Beginner Routes (5.6–5.9)

Perfect for getting your feet wet on Zion sandstone or warming up before the bigger objectives. These routes let you dial in your gear placement and get comfortable with the rock quality without the full exposure commitment.
