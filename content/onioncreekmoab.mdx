# Onion Creek Moab Climbing Guide

Onion Creek offers some of Moab's most adventurous traditional climbing, with towering sandstone walls and spires that demand solid gear skills and route-finding abilities. This area attracts climbers looking for multi-pitch adventures and classic desert tower experiences, though access requires a high-clearance vehicle for the rough dirt road. The climbing here ranges from mellow multi-pitch routes to serious aid lines that'll test your commitment.
