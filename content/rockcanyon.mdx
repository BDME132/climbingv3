# Rock Canyon Climbing Guide

Rock Canyon is one of Utah County’s favorite quick-access climbing spots — close enough to civilization that you can still make it to work after a morning session, but scenic enough to pretend you’re on a legit adventure. This guide focuses on what climbers actually care about: routes. No geology rabbit holes. No pioneer stories. Just climbs you should know before heading in.
