# Rock Canyon Climbing Guide

Rock Canyon is one of Utah County’s best “I have 3 hours, let’s go climb” spots — close enough to Provo that you can still pretend you’re responsible, but steep enough to make you forget that idea immediately. This page is just the curated hits: good routes, spread across different walls, with zero geology rabbit holes.

## Beginner-Friendly Routes (5.6–5.9)

If you’re newer, shaking off rust, or bringing a friend who says “I used to climb” (dangerous sentence), this is the safest place to start. Mostly friendly movement, reasonable grades, and solid “first Rock Canyon day” picks.

## Epic / Long Routes

These are for when you want more than a quick crag lap — multi-pitch time, bigger position, and that “we’re committed now” feeling. Pack more water than you think. (Yes, even in January. Utah is rude like that.)
