# Donnelly Canyon Indian Creek Climbing Guide

Donnelly Canyon offers some of the most accessible crack climbing in the Indian Creek system, with everything from mellow 5.7 splitters to burly 5.12 testpieces. The area sees less traffic than the main Indian Creek corridor but delivers the same quality Wingate sandstone and bomber hand jams. Park at the Donnelly Canyon pullout and hike up the wash to access multiple walls within 20 minutes.
