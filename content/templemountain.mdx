# Temple Mountain Climbing Guide

Temple Mountain offers a solid mix of sport and trad climbing on quality Navajo sandstone, with everything from mellow multi-pitch adventures to steep single-pitch sends. The area sees fewer crowds than nearby Zion, making it a great spot when you want good climbing without the circus. Access is straightforward, but check current conditions as some approach roads can be rough after weather.
