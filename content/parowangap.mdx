# Parowan Gap Climbing Guide

Parowan Gap offers solid sport climbing on volcanic rock with a mix of technical face climbing and powerful moves. The area features several distinct walls with routes ranging from moderate warm-ups to serious projects, making it a worthwhile destination for climbers looking to explore Utah's diverse rock beyond the typical sandstone. Access is straightforward, but be mindful of the cultural significance of this area to local Native American tribes.
