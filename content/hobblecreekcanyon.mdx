# Hobble Creek Canyon Climbing Guide

Hobble Creek Canyon offers some of Utah's most diverse climbing, from beginner-friendly sport routes to world-class bouldering that'll humble even the strongest crushers. The canyon is famous for its quality limestone sport climbing on the Drone Wall and Mars Bars, plus the legendary Seclusion bouldering area that hosts some of the hardest problems on the planet. Access is straightforward year-round, though winter conditions can make the approach sketchy.
