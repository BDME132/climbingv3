# Mount Olympus Climbing Guide

Mount Olympus offers some of Salt Lake City's most accessible alpine-style climbing, with everything from mellow slabs to technical trad routes spread across multiple summits. The mountain sees heavy traffic year-round, so expect company on weekends and start early for the classics.
