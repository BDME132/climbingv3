# Santaquin Canyon Climbing Guide

Santaquin Canyon is Utah's premier ice and mixed climbing destination, with some solid sport routes thrown in for good measure. Most climbers come here in winter for the world-class ice flows and challenging mixed lines, though the sport climbing on quality limestone keeps things interesting year-round. Access is straightforward via the main canyon road, but always check conditions in winter.
