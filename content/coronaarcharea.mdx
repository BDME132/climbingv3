# Corona Arch Area Climbing Guide

The Corona Arch area offers some of Utah's most diverse desert climbing, from mellow trad lines to burly overhangs across multiple canyon systems. Most climbers come here for the classic Wingate and Entrada formations, with Wall Street and Day Canyon being the main draws. Access is straightforward via the Corona Arch trailhead, but expect a bit of hiking to reach most walls.
