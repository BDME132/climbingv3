# American Fork Canyon Climbing Guide

American Fork Canyon is one of the most concentrated sport climbing areas in Utah — steep limestone, quick roadside access, and an absurd number of routes packed into a short stretch of canyon. This guide trims it down to the essentials: the climbs that actually help you decide where to go and what to get on today.
