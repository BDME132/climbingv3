# Millcreek Canyon Climbing Guide

Millcreek Canyon offers some of Salt Lake City's most accessible sport climbing, with solid limestone walls scattered throughout the canyon. The area sees climbers year-round thanks to its variety of aspects and relatively low elevation, though summer can get pretty toasty on the south-facing walls. Check current access restrictions before heading up—some areas have seasonal closures for wildlife protection.
