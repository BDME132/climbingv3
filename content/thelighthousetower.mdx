# The Lighthouse Tower Climbing Guide

The Lighthouse Tower area offers some of the most striking desert tower climbing in Utah, with solid Wingate sandstone and classic crack systems. This zone attracts climbers looking for everything from mellow trad routes to serious desert sends, with the iconic Lighthouse Tower itself serving as the centerpiece formation. Access is straightforward via the River Road, making it a popular destination for both day trips and multi-day desert adventures.
