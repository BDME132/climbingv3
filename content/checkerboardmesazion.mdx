# Checkerboard Mesa Zion Climbing Guide

Checkerboard Mesa offers some of the most accessible traditional climbing in Zion, with its distinctive cross-bedded sandstone providing natural protection and moderate grades. The mesa's north-facing routes stay cooler during hot summer months, making it a solid choice when other areas are baking. Access is straightforward from the main park road, though you'll want to check current park regulations before heading out.
