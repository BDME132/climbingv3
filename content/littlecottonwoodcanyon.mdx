# Little Cottonwood Canyon Climbing Guide

Little Cottonwood Canyon is Utah's granite playground, offering everything from mellow trad lines to world-class bouldering on some of the most beautiful rock in the Wasatch. The canyon sees heavy traffic year-round, so get there early for parking and expect crowds on weekends. Access can be restricted during high avalanche danger in winter.
