# The Hinterlands Rock Canyon Climbing Guide

The Hinterlands offers solid sport climbing on quality sandstone with routes spanning from mellow 5.7s to burly 5.13 projects. The South-Facing Wall gets sun most of the day making it perfect for cooler months, while the West-facing Wall provides afternoon shade during summer sessions. It's a straightforward approach with well-bolted routes that'll keep you busy whether you're working on your first 5.10 or pushing into double digits.
