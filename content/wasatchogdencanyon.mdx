# Wasatch | Ogden Canyon Climbing Guide

Ogden Canyon serves up some of Utah's most accessible multi-pitch trad climbing, with quality limestone and quartzite walls just minutes from town. The area's known for its moderate classics and solid gear placements, making it a go-to spot for building multi-pitch skills. Access is straightforward from Highway 39, but respect private property and park only in designated areas.
