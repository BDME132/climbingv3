# American Fork Canyon Climbing Guide

American Fork Canyon delivers some of Utah's most accessible limestone sport climbing, with everything from mellow 5.7s to burly 5.13s just 45 minutes from Salt Lake City. The canyon's multiple crags offer year-round climbing opportunities, though summer can get hot on south-facing walls. Check current access conditions before heading up—seasonal closures and parking restrictions change regularly.
