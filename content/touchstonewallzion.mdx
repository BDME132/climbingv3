# Touchstone Wall Zion Climbing Guide

Touchstone Wall offers some of Zion's most varied climbing, from mellow slabs perfect for getting your trad legs under you to burly cracks that'll test your technique. The area spans multiple walls including Cerberus Gendarme, The Confluence, and Kung Fu Theater, giving you options whether you're looking for a chill day or ready to get worked. Access is straightforward from the main canyon, but expect company on weekends—this place has earned its reputation.
