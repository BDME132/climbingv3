# Davis County Foothills Climbing Guide

The Davis County Foothills offer some of Utah's most accessible traditional and sport climbing, with solid conglomerate rock just minutes from the Wasatch Front. It's perfect for getting your trad skills dialed or knocking out quick sport sessions after work. Respect private property and seasonal closures—this area stays climbable thanks to good relationships with landowners.
