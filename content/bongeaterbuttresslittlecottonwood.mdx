# Bongeater Buttress Little Cottonwood Climbing Guide

Bongeater Buttress and the surrounding areas offer some of Little Cottonwood's most varied climbing, from mellow sport routes on Red Slab to burly trad lines on the main buttress. The area sees climbers year-round thanks to good sun exposure and relatively quick access from the parking areas. Check current access restrictions before heading up—Little Cottonwood can have seasonal closures for wildlife protection.
