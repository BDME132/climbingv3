# Pioneer Park St. George Climbing Guide

Pioneer Park offers some of the most accessible sandstone climbing in St. George, with everything from mellow trad routes to world-class boulder problems scattered across multiple formations. The park stays open year-round and provides a perfect introduction to desert climbing, though summer temps can be brutal. Respect closures during nesting season and keep noise down since you're literally climbing in the middle of town.
