# Long Canyon Moab Climbing Guide

Long Canyon delivers classic Wingate sandstone climbing with everything from mellow trad routes to burly offwidth challenges. The area features several distinct walls including Maverick Buttress, The Shipyard, and Deadman's Buttress, making it a solid destination for multi-day trips. Access is straightforward via Potash Road, but respect private property boundaries and pack out all trash.
