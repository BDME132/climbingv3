# Little Cottonwood Canyon Climbing Guide

Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is prime Wasatch granite: clean cracks, techy faces, and enough options to keep you busy for a lifetime (or at least until your fingers file a complaint). This is a curated shortlist to help you pick a good day—without turning it into a 1,000-route scroll-fest.

## Beginner Routes (5.6–5.9)

If you’re newer to LCC granite (or you just want a confidence day), these are friendly routes that still feel “real” and not like a jungle gym.
