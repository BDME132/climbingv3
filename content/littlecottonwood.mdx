# Little Cottonwood Canyon Climbing Guide

Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) is pure Wasatch granite: technical faces, splitter cracks, long slabs, and real mountain routes just a short drive from Salt Lake. The canyon is massive, so this guide trims it down to the climbs that actually help you decide what to get on—whether that’s a casual roadside lap, a classic crack, or a full-on alpine day.

## Beginner Routes (5.6–5.9)

Friendly movement, reasonable protection, and great introductions to LCC granite. Perfect for first trad leads, mellow slabs, and confidence-building days.
