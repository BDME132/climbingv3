# Thistle Area Climbing Guide

Thistle offers solid limestone climbing with a good mix of traditional and sport routes across two main areas. The Summit Wall and Booty Wall Area provide everything from mellow trad lines to burly test pieces, making it a solid destination for climbers looking to get on quality rock. Access is straightforward, but respect private property and pack out your trash.
