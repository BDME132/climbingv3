# Flaming Gorge Climbing

Flaming Gorge offers a solid mix of sport, trad, and bouldering spread across several distinct areas around the reservoir. The climbing here ranges from mellow beginner routes to serious projects, with quality sandstone that's worth the drive. Access is generally straightforward, but double-check current conditions since some areas can be affected by water levels and seasonal closures.
