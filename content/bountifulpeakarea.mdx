# Bountiful Peak Area Climbing Guide

The Bountiful Peak Area offers solid bouldering and some quality trad routes on decent rock. It's a good spot when you want something close to the valley without the crowds of the main canyons. The area sees less traffic than other Wasatch spots, so expect a bit more adventure in route finding.
