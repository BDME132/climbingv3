# Ogden Canyon Climbing Guide

Ogden Canyon serves up solid limestone climbing just minutes from town, with everything from mellow trad lines to burly sport routes. The canyon's multiple walls offer good variety for day sessions, though access can be tricky during high water periods in spring. This is classic Wasatch climbing—bring your rack and your route-finding skills.
