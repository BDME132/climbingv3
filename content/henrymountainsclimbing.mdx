# Henry Mountains Climbing Guide

The Henry Mountains offer some of Utah's most remote and rewarding desert climbing, with Black Table serving as the main destination for quality traditional routes on solid sandstone. This area attracts climbers looking to escape the crowds while testing their skills on everything from mellow corners to burly overhangs. Access requires a decent drive on dirt roads, so come prepared with water and a full tank.
