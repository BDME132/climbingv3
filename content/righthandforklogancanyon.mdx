# Right Hand Fork Logan Canyon Climbing Guide

Right Hand Fork offers some of Logan Canyon's most accessible sport climbing, with the popular Hobbit Caves serving up everything from mellow 5.7s to burly 5.12s. The limestone here is generally solid, and most routes are well-bolted, making it a go-to spot for building skills and getting mileage. Park at the obvious pullout and follow the well-worn trail to the various walls.
