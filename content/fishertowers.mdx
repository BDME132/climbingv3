# Fisher Towers Climbing Guide

Fisher Towers offers some of Utah's most iconic desert tower climbing, with towering sandstone spires that demand solid traditional climbing skills and a head for exposure. The area is famous for its classic multi-pitch routes on formations like Ancient Art and The Titan, though access can be seasonal due to raptor closures. This is pure adventure climbing where route-finding skills and comfort with loose rock are essential.
