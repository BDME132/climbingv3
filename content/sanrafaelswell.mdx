# San Rafael Swell Climbing Guide

The San Rafael Swell offers some of Utah's most adventurous desert tower climbing, with endless Wingate and Navajo sandstone formations scattered across a massive geological uplift. This is primarily trad climbing country, where you'll find everything from mellow multi-pitch adventures to serious desert objectives. Access can be complex with some areas requiring permits or having seasonal restrictions, so do your homework before heading out.
