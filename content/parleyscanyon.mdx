# Parley's Canyon Climbing Guide

Parley's Canyon offers solid sport climbing and bouldering just 20 minutes from Salt Lake City, making it a go-to spot for after-work sessions and weekend warriors. The limestone and quartzite provide everything from mellow beginner routes to burly projects, with most of the action spread across The Bungalow, Iron Curtain Wall, and Riptide Wall. Access can be tricky with seasonal closures, so check current conditions before heading out.
