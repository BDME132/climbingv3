# Moonlight Buttress Zion Climbing Guide

Moonlight Buttress offers some of Zion's most iconic big wall climbing, from mellow aid lines to world-class free routes on perfect Navajo sandstone. The area draws climbers for its stunning exposure and variety of styles, though you'll want to check current access conditions since parts of Zion require permits and have seasonal restrictions. This is desert tower climbing at its finest.
