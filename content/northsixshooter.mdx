# North Six Shooter Climbing Guide

North Six Shooter delivers classic desert tower climbing with stellar crack systems and exposed multi-pitch routes. This iconic Moab formation offers everything from moderate traditional climbs to burly finger cracks, making it a must-hit destination for trad climbers looking to test their skills on quality Wingate sandstone. The approach is straightforward, but bring plenty of water and start early during warmer months.
