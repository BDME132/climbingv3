# China Wall Logan Canyon Climbing Guide

China Wall is Logan Canyon's premier limestone destination, offering everything from mellow sport routes to world-class cave climbing. The area splits into distinct zones—China Slab for technical face climbing and China Cave for steep, powerful routes that'll test your fitness. Access is straightforward, but respect the seasonal closures and pack out your trash.
