# Red Cliffs Desert Reserve Climbing Guide

Red Cliffs Desert Reserve offers solid sport and trad climbing on quality Navajo sandstone just outside St. George. The area features multiple walls with everything from beginner-friendly routes to challenging projects, making it a go-to spot for southern Utah climbers. Access is straightforward, but respect the desert tortoise habitat and stick to established trails.
