# Huntington Canyon Climbing Guide

Huntington Canyon delivers world-class bouldering on pristine sandstone, plus seasonal ice climbing that draws alpinists from across the Intermountain West. The area's crown jewel is the Burma Road bouldering zone, where everything from V0 warm-ups to V10 testpieces await on perfect stone. Access is straightforward via Highway 31, though winter conditions can make the ice climbing areas the main attraction.
