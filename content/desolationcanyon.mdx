# Desolation Canyon Climbing Guide

Desolation Canyon offers a unique mix of remote desert bouldering and traditional climbing along the Green River in eastern Utah. The area is known for quality sandstone problems and multi-pitch adventures, but access requires significant planning since most climbing areas are only reachable by river trip or long hiking approaches. This is definitely more of a destination climbing area than a day-trip spot.
