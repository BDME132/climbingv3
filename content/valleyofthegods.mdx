# Valley of the Gods Climbing Guide

Valley of the Gods serves up classic desert tower climbing on bomber Wingate sandstone, with everything from mellow multi-pitch adventures to burly crack testpieces. The area's scattered towers and spires make for excellent objective-style climbing, though most folks come for the moderate trad routes and stunning red rock scenery. Access is straightforward via the Valley of the Gods scenic drive, but bring everything you need since services are sparse.
