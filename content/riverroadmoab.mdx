# River Road Moab Climbing Guide

River Road delivers some of Moab's most accessible desert tower climbing, with everything from mellow sport routes to burly trad lines scattered across iconic red rock formations. The area stretches along Highway 279, offering quick approaches and stellar Colorado River views that make it a go-to for both visiting climbers and locals looking for a solid session. Most crags are visible from the road, so you can scope your objectives while driving in.
