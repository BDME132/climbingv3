# Stansbury Mountains Climbing Guide

The Stansbury Mountains offer a solid mix of sport and trad climbing across several distinct areas, from the popular South Willow Canyon to the remote Three Coffins formation in the West Desert. You'll find everything from mellow trad lines to steep sport routes, with most areas requiring a bit of hiking to reach the goods. Access is generally straightforward, but check current conditions for the more remote desert areas.
