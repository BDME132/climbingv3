# House Range Climbing Guide

The House Range offers some of Utah's most diverse limestone climbing, from beginner-friendly sport routes to serious multi-pitch trad lines. Scattered across multiple canyons and formations, this area rewards exploration with quality stone and relatively uncrowded walls. Access varies by location, so check current conditions and respect private land boundaries.
